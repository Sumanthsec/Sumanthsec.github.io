        <p class="section-text">Juan still remembers the tremor of the earth beneath his feet when the first shovel broke ground. Raised in the vineyards of Chile, he brought his deep-rooted knowledge to the nascent rows of Pilot Hill. Over decades, Juan’s hands have shaped every vine, ensuring that each cluster reaches its full potential. His unwavering dedication is woven into the very character of our exceptional wines.</p>

        <p class="section-text">Crimson Slopes thrives on a vibrant tapestry of talent and passion. Mateo, born and raised among the vines of Napa Valley, brings generations of vineyard mastery and sustainable practices. Elara, a New Zealand native, infuses her experience crafting nuanced wines from diverse terroirs into our cellar. Alongside them is a broader community of enthusiasts—from seasoned agriculturalists to passionate newcomers—united by their love for the land and the vine. Together, they ensure that every bottle tells a story of exceptional quality born from a collaborative heart.</p>
